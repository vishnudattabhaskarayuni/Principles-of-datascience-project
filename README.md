Kansas City Crime Data Analysis

The main aim of this project is to analyze the Kansas City Crime Dataset, which consists of several input features, and understand what types of crimes are most frequently committed in different parts of the city. Understanding how this analysis helps the community solve its problems by surveilling the area based on the crimes committed.
